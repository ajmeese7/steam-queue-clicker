# steam-queue-clicker
This script is used to automatically click through your Steam queues during
sales to earn you trading cards.

I know there are browser extensions and browser scripts that can be used to
accomplish this same result, but I preferred not having to put anything in my
browser. And to be fair, I also wanted to practice my automation skills with Nightmare.
This script uses Electron to run an independent browser for you to click through
the queues.
